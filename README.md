# 🚗 Number Plate Recognition System

This project is a Python-based **Number Plate Recognition System** that automatically detects and reads vehicle license plates from images or videos using **OpenCV** and **Tesseract OCR**.

---

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time number plate detection from webcam or video
- Image-based plate recognition
- Automatic plate localization using OpenCV
- Character segmentation and recognition with Tesseract OCR
- Works on various vehicle types and plate formats
- Easy to modify and expand for regional plate systems

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Tesseract OCR (for character recognition)
- NumPy (for array operations)
